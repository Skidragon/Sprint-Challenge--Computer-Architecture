1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

The CPU does provide concurrency by switching tasks super fast, it does context switching by getting interupted from a task that is higher priority then once the higher priority task is completed, it comes back to the task we were once on. It uses a scheduler in order to find what operations are top priority and in what order to execute them. Parallelism is different, it is when two tasks are executing at the exact same time, this can happen when multiple CPUs do completely different, non-dependent tasks simultaneously.

Machine language is what the computer can interpret. It converts those binary numbers to turn on/off the transistors in the order needed to perform an operation.
